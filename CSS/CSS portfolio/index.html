          <h2>Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer</h2>

          <p>I'm a Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer whose passion lies in computer programming. In my work as an engineer I've had to use a lot of counter intuitive software. Curious as to why these programs worked the way they do, I started learning how to code. As i started learning I've came across many technologies. One that amazed me is how an AI provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>

          <p>This passion carried me through my education. I studied new languages, algorithms, technology, compilers. And it was here that i learned truly how much there was to learn yet.</p>
            
          <p> Now I'm further expanding my knowledge in developing, implementing and integrating new application with Technical Proficiency C, C++, Java,Python, Cloud Computing. </p>

            <div class="Acc-summary">
              <p>This project aims to build an intelligent vehicle, it is capable of reaching the destination safely and intelligently thus avoiding the risk of human errors. Many existing algorithms like lane detection, obstacle detection are combined together to provide the necessary control to the vehicle. With the number of accidents increasing, it has become important to take over the human errors.  All of this could come to an end with self-driving vehicles and then let the passengers continue with their work. The work could be enhanced by improving the algorithm by adding machine learning to it. It is accurate but its efficiency could be further enhanced if it starts learning by itself and avoid unnecessary calculations of the regions which are already known.</p>
