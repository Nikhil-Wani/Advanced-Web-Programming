# HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.

Why to Learn HTML?
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.

HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning HTML:

1. Create Web site - You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know HTML well.

2. Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.

# CSS

What is CSS?

1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
3. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
4. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS Solved a Big Problem:

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
